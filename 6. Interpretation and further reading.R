##6. Interpretation and further reading

##What assumptions have we made in this analysis?

#1. It was logical and valid to join the two datasets. Justified by similar temporal period and spatial scope (late 1970s, UK/England).

#2. The data meanings have been interpreted and used correctly. This requires proper investigation of metadata to understand e.g. units, methods of measurement that will influence interpretation of the results

#3. The spatial scales are comparable. Here we had two problems to contend with: 1) the CS data locations were given at a lower resolution to preserve confidentiality, 2) the ag census data was then averaged to the scale of the low resolution CS data. Consider what this means for interpretation - what would you write in a paper?


#How could this analysis be improved?

# - Would alternative data sources have been more appropriate?
# - Was the scaling appropriate?
# - Would additional data sources have been useful?


#Possible extensions to the exercise:

# - Look at the changes between 1978 and another year where both Ag census and CS were conducted (1990, 1998 or 2007) - what additional questions can be asked? What additional assumptions are made to do so?
# - Consider other data types from Ag Census and CS - both are available online
# - Consider joining in additional data e.g. climate data from the Met Office
